# Queen of Hearts Card

This project is a personalized visual representation of the Queen of Hearts playing card, created using only HTML and CSS. The design is purely CSS-based, with the exception of the 'Q' and heart symbols, which are rendered using Unicode characters.

## Features

- Pure CSS implementation (no images or SVGs)
- Detailed queen figure design
- Ornate decorative elements
- Responsive layout
- Cross-browser compatible

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the card and its elements
- **CSS3**: Styling and design, including borders, colors, and shapes

## How It Works

The card is structured using several key components:

1. **Card Container**: A div container (`.card`) with:
   - Rounded corners and shadow effects
   - Corner elements for rank and suit
   - Central design area

2. **Queen's Figure**: Created using advanced CSS properties:
   - `border-radius` for curved elements
   - `box-shadow` for depth and decorative effects
   - `transform` properties for symmetrical elements and rotations

3. **Symbols and Characters**:
   - Unicode characters for rank ('Q') and suit ('â™¥')
   - Consistent styling for visual harmony

4. **Mirroring Effects**:
   - Strategic use of CSS transforms
   - Rotated elements for playing card symmetry
   - Carefully positioned decorative elements
